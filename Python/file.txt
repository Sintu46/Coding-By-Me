Hi Viewers, Welocome for learning the python.It was the festival of spring.From the wintry
shades of narrow lanes and alleys emerged a gaily clad humanity.Some walked ,some rode on 
horses,other sat, being carried in bamboo and bullock carts. One little boy ran between 
his father's legs, brimming over with life and daughter."Come, child, come,"called his 
parents
